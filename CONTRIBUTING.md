# Guidelines

Before creating an issue, try search first, and browse closed issues.

When creating an issue, state what modules you are trying to use, what you are trying to achieve, what problem you have and what else you have already tried to solve it.

Please provide a snippet of your code you have trouble with.

Use code formatting of GitHub when pasting code, [see examples](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#syntax-highlighting). For large code snippets, it is better to use [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/) and providing a link in your issue or reply.

Be polite.
