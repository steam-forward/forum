## Learn JavaScript

If you have trouble understanding READMEs or examples of modules, perhaps you [don't know JavaScript](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/) good enough. JavaScript is a language decievably easy to start with, but many (especially client-side) programmers rarely use it to its full potential. However, Node.js programming actually requires to understand and use most of the JavaScript techniques. So, [learn](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/)! It is well worth your time.

Another great way to learn JS and Node.js-related stuff is [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/). Check it out!
