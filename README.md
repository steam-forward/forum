# Forum about coding for Steam on JS

The goal of this forum is to create a place where people can discuss developing Steam-related applications, using Steam Web API in JS, and various Steam-related JS libs.

If you have trouble using any of Steam-related module for Node.js, this repo's [Issues](https://github.com/steam-forward/node-steam-forum/issues) is the best place to ask for help. Please, be considerate, don't expect that anyone will code everything for you. If you are unsure if you found a bug or not, it is also better to ask here first.

Be polite. Be efficient.

If you have trouble understanding READMEs or examples of modules, perhaps you [don't know JavaScript](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/) good enough. JavaScript is a language decievably easy to start with, but many (especially client-side) programmers rarely use it to its full potential. However, Node.js programming actually requires to understand and use most of the JavaScript techniques. So, [learn](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/)! It is well worth your time.

Before creating an issue, try search, and browse closed issues.

When creating an issue, state what modules you are trying to use, what you are trying to achieve, what problem you have and what else you are already tried to solve it.

__Do not bump issues.__ Forum subscribers receive all issues by email anyway.

Use code formatting of GitHub when pasting code, [see help](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#syntax-highlighting). For large code snippets, it is better to use [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/) and providing a link in your issue or reply.
